# ðŸš€ Chat with Database ðŸš€

## Overview
"Chat with Database" is an innovative tool that bridges the gap between natural language and SQL. It allows users to query databases simply by typing in everyday language, with the system translating it into SQL queries and displaying the results. This project empowers non-technical users to access and manipulate data with ease, making data insights accessible to everyone.

## Features
- **Natural Language Querying**: Users can type queries in plain language, and the tool translates them into SQL commands.
- **Intent Understanding**: The system interprets the userâ€™s intent, converting it into the right SQL syntax.
- **Data Retrieval & Display**: Retrieves data from the database and presents it in an easy-to-read format.
- **User-Friendly**: Makes database interaction accessible to users with minimal technical skills.

## Why This Matters
"Chat with Database" saves time and unlocks new insights by making data retrieval as simple as sending a text. No SQL knowledge is needed, making it ideal for analysts, business users, and teams seeking data-driven decisions.
